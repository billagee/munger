Munger is a sqlite3-based wrapper around your hosts file. The intent is for the user to be able to add sets of IP addresses and associated hostnames that can be activated and deactived as the user desires. 

---USAGE INSTRUCTIONS---
Run the munger CLI app with the following commands:
munger add-ip <hostname> <ip-address> <set>	— New sets are automatically added. All arguments must be present
munger sets?								— Lists all currently available sets
munger list-ips <set>						— Lists all IPs and hostnames for a given set
munger import <file.csv>					— Imports CSV file with header of hostname,ip,set NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
munger help									— Displays usage instructions 
munger activate <set>						— Activates a set of IPs in the hosts file. *Must be run as root*, otherwise it won't succeed.
munger revert								— Restores the backed up hosts file. Must be run as root.
munger delete <set>							— Deletes all IP and hostname entries associated with a given set.
munger remove <hostname> <set>				— Removes the specified hostname entry (and associated IP address) from the given set.
munger active?								- Lists the currently active set and all of its associated IP addresses and hostnames.

This project was mostly done as a learning exercise, but also because I wanted a tool like this. I have to think it'd be handy for web developers in general, too.

To install, download the source, and run 'python setup.py install'. The munger app will be added to your PATH, and you can then use it from the command line. The modules will be available for your python programs, but I'm not sure why you would want to use them — they're all too tied to munger to be generically useful.

TBD:
	- Add hostname dupe checking while writing IPs and hostnames
	- Support for linux and windows (currently only supports Mac OS X)
	- Finish the csv import functionality
	- When removing sets, if that set is active, revert the hosts file to the original
	- When removing individual IPs, if it's part of a set that's active, remove the IP from the hosts file
	- When removing the last IP in a set, the set should be deleted, too.
	- Other ideas? Requests?

Known Issues:
	- If you fail to run the activate command as sudo, the set will still be considered active by the database, so you have to run revert before you can activate for real
